# JSON-RPC Protocol Issue Diagnostic Analysis

## Current Problem

The command `echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"list_tools","params":{}}' | node dist/index.js` is not returning any data, even when the `--server` flag is added. The process completes without producing any output or errors.

## System Analysis

After examining the codebase, I've identified several architectural components related to the JSON-RPC handling:

### Architecture Overview

1. **Main Entry Point (`src/index.ts`)**
   - Only exports components from other modules
   - Does not appear to execute the CLI code directly
   - Comment says "CLI isn't exported as it's an entrypoint"

2. **CLI Module (`src/cli/main.ts`)**
   - Contains the command-line argument parsing logic
   - Defines the server mode via `--server` flag
   - Calls `startServer()` function when in server mode

3. **Server Implementation (`src/server/mcp-server.ts`)**
   - Creates and configures the MCP server
   - Implements JSON-RPC request handling
   - Has a direct stdin handler for debugging

4. **Build Configuration**
   - TypeScript compiles the code to `dist/` directory
   - Docker configuration calls `node dist/index.js --server`
   - Test commands use echo to pipe JSON-RPC requests

### Identified Issues

1. **Incomplete Entry Point**
   - `src/index.ts` exports module components but doesn't execute the CLI
   - The compiled `dist/index.js` may not be running any executable code

2. **Parallel JSON-RPC Implementations**
   - Custom stdin handler in `startServer()` 
   - Separate implementation in `test-jsonrpc.js`
   - Potential conflict or redundancy in handling

3. **Command Line Argument Parsing**
   - Server only starts with `--server` flag
   - Without the flag, it shows help and exits

4. **Stdin/Stdout Handling**
   - Debug logging uses `console.error()` (stderr)
   - Actual JSON-RPC responses should use `process.stdout.write()`

## Docker vs Local Execution

- Docker configuration runs with `--server` flag by default
- Docker tests work according to makefile targets
- Local execution requires explicit flags

## Communication Flow Analysis

The expected flow for JSON-RPC processing should be:

1. JSON-RPC request comes in through stdin
2. Request is parsed and validated
3. Appropriate handler is called based on the method
4. Response is written to stdout

This flow appears to be broken in the current implementation, likely due to the entry point not properly executing the CLI code or the server mode not being activated correctly.
