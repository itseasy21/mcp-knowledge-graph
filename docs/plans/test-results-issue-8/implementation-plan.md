# Implementation Plan: Publish Test Results in GitHub UI (Issue #8)

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps needed to implement test result publishing for GitHub Actions workflows in the MCP Knowledge Graph Improved project. This will enhance visibility of test outcomes in the GitHub UI, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot test failures.

## Phase 1: Setup Test Reporter Dependencies

This phase involves installing and configuring the necessary dependencies to generate test report outputs compatible with GitHub Actions.

### Task 1.1: Add Mocha Reporter for GitHub Actions

- Install the Mocha JUnit reporter package to generate XML test reports
- Update package.json to include the new dependency
- Configure the test script to output results in the appropriate format

### Task 1.2: Configure Report Output Directory

- Create a dedicated directory for test reports
- Ensure the directory is excluded from version control
- Update the test script to output reports to this directory

## Phase 2: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

This phase involves modifying the GitHub Actions workflow files to capture and publish test results.

### Task 2.1: Update CI Workflow to Publish Unit Test Results

- Modify the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to include steps for publishing test results
- Configure GitHub Actions to upload the JUnit test reports
- Set up test report annotations in the GitHub UI

### Task 2.2: Configure Docker Test Result Publishing

- Modify the Docker test execution to output test results
- Update the CI workflow to include Docker test results
- Ensure Docker tests results are properly captured and reported

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

This phase involves testing the new test reporting functionality.

### Task 3.1: Test Reporting in CI Environment

- Create a test branch with failing tests to verify reporting
- Confirm that test results are visible in the GitHub UI
- Verify that test failures are properly highlighted

### Task 3.2: Document Test Reporting Features

- Update documentation to explain how test results are displayed
- Add information about how to interpret test reports in the GitHub UI

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Unit test results from Mocha are automatically published to GitHub Actions
2. Docker test results are visible in the GitHub Actions UI
3. Test failures are clearly identifiable with appropriate context
4. All tests continue to run correctly with the new reporting configuration
5. Documentation is updated to reflect the new test reporting capabilities
