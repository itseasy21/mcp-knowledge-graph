# Plan: Populate Knowledge Graph for mcp-knowledge-graph-improved (Issue #2)

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive representation of the `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` project within the `memory` MCP server's knowledge graph to facilitate understanding for future agents.

**Phases:**

**Phase 1: Define Core Project and Components**
*   **Task 1.1:** Create the main project entity.
    *   **Success Criteria:** An entity named `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` of type `Project` exists in the graph.
*   **Task 1.2:** Create entities for major functional components.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Entities named `CLI Interface`, `Knowledge Graph Manager`, `MCP Server Implementation`, and `Type Definitions` of type `Component` exist in the graph.
*   **Task 1.3:** Establish relationships between the project and its components.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `CONTAINS` relations exist from `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` to each component entity created in Task 1.2.

**Phase 2: Define Source Files and Relationships**
*   **Task 2.1:** Create entities for key source files.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Entities exist for `src/index.ts`, `src/cli/main.ts`, `src/graph/manager.ts`, `src/server/mcp-server.ts`, `src/types/knowledge-graph.ts` with type `SourceFile`.
*   **Task 2.2:** Establish relationships between components and their primary source files.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `IMPLEMENTED_IN` relations exist from `CLI Interface` to `src/cli/main.ts`, `Knowledge Graph Manager` to `src/graph/manager.ts`, `MCP Server Implementation` to `src/server/mcp-server.ts`, and `Type Definitions` to `src/types/knowledge-graph.ts`.
*   **Task 2.3:** Establish relationship between the main entry point and the project.
    *   **Success Criteria:** An `ENTRY_POINT_IS` relation exists from `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` to `src/index.ts`.

**Phase 3: Add Detailed Observations**
*   **Task 3.1:** Add observations to the Project entity.
    *   **Success Criteria:** The `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` entity has observations detailing its purpose (MCP server for persistent KG memory), language (TypeScript), and primary function.
*   **Task 3.2:** Add observations to Component entities.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Each component entity has observations describing its specific role (e.g., "Handles command-line arguments", "Manages KG data persistence and search", "Implements MCP tool handlers", "Defines core data structures").
*   **Task 3.3:** Add observations to SourceFile entities.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Key source file entities have observations mentioning important classes or functions they define (e.g., `KnowledgeGraphManager` class in `src/graph/manager.ts`, `createServer` function in `src/server/mcp-server.ts`).

**Phase 4: Represent Dependencies and Scripts**
*   **Task 4.1:** Create entities for key runtime dependencies.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Entities exist for `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `commander` with type `Dependency`.
*   **Task 4.2:** Create entities for key development dependencies.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Entities exist for `typescript`, `mocha`, `ts-node` with type `DevDependency`.
*   **Task 4.3:** Establish relationships between the project and its dependencies.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `DEPENDS_ON` relations exist from `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` to the dependency entities created in Tasks 4.1 and 4.2.
*   **Task 4.4:** Create entities for npm scripts.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Entities exist for `build`, `test`, `start`, `watch` with type `Script`.
*   **Task 4.5:** Establish relationships between the project and its scripts.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `HAS_SCRIPT` relations exist from `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` to the script entities created in Task 4.4.

**Phase 5: Represent Documentation**
*   **Task 5.1:** Create entities for key documentation/configuration files.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Entities exist for `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `Dockerfile`, `makefile`, `package.json` with type `Documentation` or `ConfigurationFile` as appropriate.
*   **Task 5.2:** Establish relationships between the project and these files.
    *   **Success Criteria:** `HAS_DOCUMENTATION` or `HAS_CONFIGURATION` relations exist from `mcp-knowledge-graph-improved` to the entities created in Task 5.1.

**Phase 6: Final Review and Verification**
*   **Task 6.1:** Read the entire graph from the `memory` server.
    *   **Success Criteria:** The `read_graph` tool successfully retrieves the graph data.
*   **Task 6.2:** Verify the graph structure and content against the plan.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Manual verification confirms that all planned entities, relations, and key observations are present and accurately represent the project structure.
