# MCP Server Issue Analysis and Solution

## Overview

This document analyzes the issues with our current Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation and provides a detailed solution. The MCP server is not working properly because it's not correctly establishing a connection between the server and its transport mechanism.

## Problem Analysis

The MCP server requires proper setup and connection to a transport mechanism to facilitate communication with clients. Our current implementation has several key issues:

### 1. Missing Transport Connection

The most critical issue is that our current server implementation creates the server but never connects it to a transport mechanism. The MCP protocol requires explicit connection to a transport (in this case, StdioServerTransport) to function properly.

### 2. Custom Stdin Handling Interference

Our current implementation includes custom stdin/stdout handling code that intercepts and attempts to process JSON-RPC messages directly, rather than allowing the MCP transport to handle them. This interferes with the proper MCP protocol operation.

### 3. Incorrect Server Operation Flow

The server is created but then simply keeps the process alive with `process.stdin.resume()` rather than properly connecting and running the MCP protocol.

## Code Comparison

### Current Implementation (Not Working)

#### Server Creation (src/server/mcp-server.ts)

```typescript
// Function to start the server
export const startServer = async (memoryPath?: string) => {
    // Remove debug logs

    // Create a server instance
    const server = createServer(memoryPath);

    // Handle stdin directly for debugging
    process.stdin.on('data', (data) => {
        try {
            // Parse the JSON-RPC request
            const request = JSON.parse(data.toString().trim());
            // Remove debug log: Received request

            // Handle list_tools request directly
            if (request.method === "list_tools") {
                const response = {
                    jsonrpc: "2.0",
                    id: request.id,
                    result: {
                        tools: [
                            {
                                name: "test_tool",
                                description: "Test tool for debugging",
                                inputSchema: { type: "object", properties: {} }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                };

                // Remove debug log: Sending response
                process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(response) + '\n');
            }
        } catch (error) {
            // Remove debug log: Error handling request
        }
    });

    // Remove debug logs: Server created, Knowledge Graph MCP Server running on stdio, Waiting for JSON-RPC requests...

    // Keep the process alive
    process.stdin.resume();

    return server;
};
```

### Working Implementation (From Your File)

```javascript
// Function to start the server
async function main() {
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);
  console.error("Knowledge Graph MCP Server running on stdio");
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error("Fatal error in main():", error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Key Differences

1. **Transport Connection**:
   - Working implementation: Creates a `StdioServerTransport` and connects the server to it with `await server.connect(transport)`
   - Current implementation: No transport creation or connection

2. **Message Handling**:
   - Working implementation: Relies on the MCP transport to handle message parsing and routing
   - Current implementation: Manually intercepts stdin data and attempts to handle JSON-RPC messages

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Working implementation: Has proper top-level error handling
   - Current implementation: Has limited error handling in the custom stdin handler

## Solution

To fix the MCP server, we need to:

1. Remove the custom stdin handler that's interfering with the MCP protocol
2. Properly create and connect the server to a StdioServerTransport
3. Follow the MCP protocol for message handling

### Implementation Fix

The `startServer` function should be updated to:

```typescript
export const startServer = async (memoryPath?: string) => {
    // Create a server instance
    const server = createServer(memoryPath);
    
    // Create and connect transport
    const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
    await server.connect(transport);
    
    console.error("Knowledge Graph MCP Server running on stdio");
    
    return server;
};
```

This implementation:
- Creates the server (as before)
- Creates a StdioServerTransport instance
- Connects the server to the transport using `await server.connect(transport)`
- Removes the custom stdin data handler that interferes with the protocol

## Testing the Fix

After implementing the fix, you can test the MCP server using:

```bash
make test-cli
```

This will send a JSON-RPC request to list tools and verify that the server responds correctly.

## Conclusion

The main issue with our MCP server is the missing connection between the server and its transport mechanism. By properly creating a StdioServerTransport and connecting it to the server, we can ensure that the MCP protocol operates correctly, enabling proper communication between the server and clients.
