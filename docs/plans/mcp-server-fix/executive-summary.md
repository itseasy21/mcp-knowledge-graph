# MCP Server Fix: Executive Summary

## Issue Overview

Our Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is not functioning properly due to a critical architectural issue: **the server is never properly connected to its transport mechanism**. This connection is essential for the MCP protocol to function.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Missing Transport Connection**: The server is created but never connected to a StdioServerTransport.
2. **Custom Message Handling Interference**: Custom stdin/stdout handling code is intercepting messages before the MCP transport can process them.
3. **Incorrect Server Lifecycle**: The server startup process doesn't follow the MCP protocol specifications.

## Root Cause

The root cause is in the `startServer` function in `src/server/mcp-server.ts`. The current implementation:

```typescript
export const startServer = async (memoryPath?: string) => {
    const server = createServer(memoryPath);
    
    // Custom stdin handler (interferes with MCP)
    process.stdin.on('data', (data) => { ... });
    
    // Just keeps process alive, doesn't connect server
    process.stdin.resume();
    
    return server;
};
```

The working implementation from your file has a critical difference:

```javascript
async function main() {
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);
  console.error("Knowledge Graph MCP Server running on stdio");
}
```

## Recommended Solution

The solution is to remove the custom stdin handling and properly connect the server to a StdioServerTransport:

```typescript
export const startServer = async (memoryPath?: string) => {
    // Create a server instance
    const server = createServer(memoryPath);
    
    // Create and connect transport
    const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
    await server.connect(transport);
    
    console.error("Knowledge Graph MCP Server running on stdio");
    
    return server;
};
```

## Implementation Impact

1. **Minimal Code Changes**: The fix requires modifications to just one function.
2. **No API Changes**: External interfaces remain unchanged.
3. **No Dependency Changes**: No new dependencies are required.

## Testing Approach

After implementing the fix, test using:
1. `make test-cli` - Basic JSON-RPC request test
2. `make docker-test` - Test in Docker environment
3. Manual testing with sample tool calls

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommended code changes
2. Run the tests to verify the fix
3. Consider adding more robust error handling
